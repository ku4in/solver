# solver
Simple python script to solve equations and systems of equations

**Usage:** solver.py [data]

_`data` is a file containig equations and systems of equations (each equation on a new line) separated by a blank line. Any lowercase character a..z is treated as variable. If `data` file is not specified then solver.py reads standart input. In this case it does not print equations themselves before solutions, so this can be used as an interactive mode._
